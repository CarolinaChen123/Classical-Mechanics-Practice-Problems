# Classical-Mechanics-Practice-Problems
I am an Engineering Physics student who have just learned Classical Mechanics during the last semester. Now I am just using what I have learned from Python to review my knowledge of Classical Mechanics. Just for fun! :)

The book I am using is "Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems (Fifth Edition)" written by Stephen T. Thornton and Jerry B. Marrion. :)
